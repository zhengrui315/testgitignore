this repo is to test how `.gitignore` file works.
- whether we need to specifiy the directory
- whether files will be uploaded to github

In my local repo, there is a file named `secretprops.properties` in `tieredconf`. It seems we don't need to specify the directory in `.gitignore`. Also, github doesn't contain untracked files.
